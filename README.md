What is happening:

- The white square is the Player. The player can be moved using the arrow keys or WASD. The player starts with 5 lives
- Enemies spawn offscreen the right. When an enemy is spawned, the Enemies count in the UI goes up
- The enemies move left and get removed when they go offscreen
- If the player and enemy collide, the player looses a life
- If the player looses all their lives, its game over

## Instructions

- Create a new empty Godot project for the test. 
- I suggest you put your project on github straight away in case your computer crashes
- Make commits throughout the test whenever you get a feature working
- Here is a [link to a sprite you can use](32x32white.png). Download it and put into your project
- When you are complete, zip your folder up and submit through brightspace. Submit your github url for the project if you used it
